# Image classification tutorial implemented with TensorFlow and PyTorch

## Dataset
For training the model, you need to download the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I5GO-GpEN7t0KYj-2nXzrMbHwFpPSaqs/view?usp=share_link).  
Then, move the downloaded images to
```
--data
```

## Tensorflow
